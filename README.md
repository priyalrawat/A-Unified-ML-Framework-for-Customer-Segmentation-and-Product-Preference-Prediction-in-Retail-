# A-Unified-ML-Framework-for-Customer-Segmentation-and-Product-Preference-Prediction-in-Retail-
**Abstract**

This study offers a comprehensive machine learning method for customer segmentation and product purchase prediction, utilizing a real-world retail marketing dataset from Kaggle combining customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and marketing campaign responses. Various unsupervised learning models such as K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN were performed before and after various forms of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Following PCA K-Means performed better with K-Means achieving a silhouette score of 0.38, compared to 0.21 before PCA, and showed improved clustering separability relating to customer groups with ten targets identified that could be interpreted easily. DBSCAN didnâ€™t work out after PCA. In the supervised modelling phase, five classification models were built to predict what the next product a customer would purchase. Of the models, XGBoost had the highest performance with F1 scores of 0.4666 before hyperparameter tuning and 0.4707 after tuning with a minimum amount of gain. Random Forest maintained similar performance at both the non-tuned and tuned states, highlighting that there is little room for improvement with these features. The performance of the models was not at par and relevant for real world settings. Cluster labels and product prediction outputs were presented at the same time, giving customers insights into what products could be considered next, thus better personalizing their profile. The predictive improvements detailed in this study were limited, however, this study has demonstrated that retail businesses can substantially benefit by integrating unsupervised and supervised modelling outputs to influence, better inform, customer data-driven retail strategies. The performance of the models was not at par and relevant for real world settings. Future work includes integrating deep learning models.
